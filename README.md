# SimpleCalc
This is a simple calc: after downloading the source code, just run the file main.py to test the calculator. The algorithm is naive as this is just a sample project to test PyQt and its functionality. The right use of the calc is (..(x[op]y) [op]...). Plesae, always remember to close the parentheses.
